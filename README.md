# cpu wattage monitor  

a simple cpu wattage monitor made in java.

---

### usage  
you can build the project yourself or just grab the compiled jar here:  
https://github.com/GavinCoded/CPU-Wattage-Monitor/releases/tag/WattageMonitor  

you’ll need to run it with sudo:  
sudo java -jar Monitor.jar

this is meant for linux systems tested on fedora 42.

### why i made this  
my system kept crashing, and i wanted to check if it was a power supply issue. turns out, it was. figured i’d make this public since i had it lying around and got bored.

### why java?  
i was bored.

### license  
mit license

### misc  
this depends on intel rapl and amd’s equivalent power interfaces.  
only tested on intel specifically on a 13th gen intel® core™ i7-13700f (24) @ 5.20 ghz.  
no testing was done on amd systems.
